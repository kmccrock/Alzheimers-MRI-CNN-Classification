# Alzheimers-MRI-CNN-Classification
I used Python/TensorFlow/Keras to build a Convolutional Neural Network to classify Alzheimerâ€™s MRIs with 99.53% accuracy.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
- Analyze dataset distribution
- Generate TensorFlow dataset
- Visualize data
- Split into train, validation, and test datasets (80/10/10)
- Construct CNN model
- Train model and visualize training results
- Evaluate model (99.53% accuracy)
- Make predictions and generate classification report + confusion matrix
